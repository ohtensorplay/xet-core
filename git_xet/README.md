Git-Xet is a Git LFS custom transfer agent that implements upload and download of files using the Xet protocol. Install `git-xet`, follow your regular workflow to `git lfs track ...` & `git add ...` & `git commit ...` & `git push`, and your files are transferred directly between the client and the Xet CAS negotiated by the repository server. Enjoy the dedupe!

## Installation
### Prerequisite
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) installed and configured correctly.
### macOS or Linux (amd64 or aarch64)
 To install using Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install git-xet
   git xet install
   ```
 Or, using an installation script, run the following in your terminal (requires `curl` and `unzip`):
   ```
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohtensorplay/xet-core/refs/heads/main/git_xet/install.sh | sh
   ```
  To verify the installation, run:
   ```
   git xet --version
   ```

### Windows (amd64)
 Using `winget`:
 ```
 winget install git-xet
 ```

 Using an installer: 
 - Download `git-xet-windows-installer-x86_64.zip` from the [MEGA Git-Xet releases](https://github.com/ohtensorplay/xet-core/releases) and unzip.
 - Run the `msi` installer file and follow the prompts.
   
 Manual installation:
 - Download `git-xet-windows-x86_64.zip` from the [MEGA Git-Xet releases](https://github.com/ohtensorplay/xet-core/releases) and unzip.
 - Place the extracted `git-xet.exe` under a `PATH` directory.
 - Run `git-xet install` in a terminal.

To verify the installation, run:
  ```
  git xet --version
  ```

## Uninstall
### macOS or Linux
Using Homebrew:
   ```
   git xet uninstall
   brew uninstall git-xet
   ```
If you used the installation script (for MacOS or Linux), run the following in your terminal:
   ```
   git xet uninstall
   sudo rm $(which git-xet)
   ```
### Windows
If you used `winget`:
```
winget uninstall git-xet
```

If you used the installer:
- Navigate to Settings -> Apps -> Installed apps
- Find "Git-Xet".
- Select the "Uninstall" option available in the context menu.

If you manually installed:
- Run `git xet uninstall` in a terminal. 
- Delete the `git-xet.exe` file from the location where it was originally placed.

## How It Works
Git-Xet registers `xet` for uploads and `xet-download` for downloads. The separate download name preserves compatibility with older Git-Xet clients, which advertised `xet` but only implemented uploads. On `git push`, `git fetch`, or `git pull`, Git LFS sends all locally registered agent names in the Batch API request and the server selects one. When the matching Xet agent is selected, Git LFS delegates the operation to `git-xet`, while the repository server remains the token and metadata control plane rather than proxying file bytes.

For more details, see the Git LFS [Batch API](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/api/batch.md) and [Custom Transfer Agent](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/custom-transfers.md) documentation.
